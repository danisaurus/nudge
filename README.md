nudge
=========

Nudge is an application that provides passive monitoring with active consent. Nudge allows users to opt into being monitored for signs of depression based on their online social activities and lets them define their own support network to be notified under their own conditions.

# How It Works:
1. Sign up with the application.
2. Allow nudge to monitor your gmail and twitter for inactivity and sentiment. 
3. Set up a support network of people whom you trust. 
4. Set up nudges based on your preferences (e.g. If you go inactive on your gmail for a specific amount of time, write a nudge message you would like your supporters to recieve.)
5. Check in with yourself by indicating your present mood. 
6. Track your daily moods by viewing your activity chart.
7.
